This repository stores implementation to Support Vector Machine Learning Algorithm


Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. Though we say regression problems as well its best suited for classification. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points.


    Here in this project I will be analyzing  the famous iris data set!
    
    The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

    The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
    
    
    The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

            The three classes in the Iris dataset:

            Iris-setosa (n=50)
            Iris-versicolor (n=50)
            Iris-virginica (n=50)
            The four features of the Iris dataset:

            sepal length in cm
            sepal width in cm
            petal length in cm
            petal width in cm
